Each student is required to prepare a written project in his/her field of research. The topic is general, and not part of the thesis work. The oral examination is based on the contents of this report. The Graduate Program Committee appoints an examination committee in consultation with the thesis supervisor. The supervisor is responsible for the subject chosen and also acts as a member of the examining committee for the oral presentation. The comprehensive examination must be completed within four months after the candidate's initial registration in the PhD program. The grade for this course is a Pass or Fail. In case of failure in the first attempt, only one more attempt is allowed to take place.|https://www.concordia.ca/academics/graduate/calendar/current/fasc/phys-phd.html
890|PHYS|Doctoral Research and Thesis (69 credits)|A student who has passed the comprehensive examination is admitted to candidacy for the PhD degree. The student is allowed to continue working on a research project under the direction of a faculty member of the department only after passing the comprehensive examination. The research is in areas which reflect the interests of the faculty and the facilities of the department. The thesis must make a distinct and original contribution to knowledge, and be presented in acceptable literary form.|https://www.concordia.ca/academics/graduate/calendar/current/fasc/phys-phd.html

It focuses on better understanding how similar phenomena may operate at different levels, how phenomena at any one level are shaped by phenomena at other levels, and the reciprocal dynamics that exist between levels to make up the world of organizations in which we live and work. Meso organizational behaviour is important because: (a) it helps students of human resource management better understand the systemic factors that contribute to how individuals think, feel, and act in organizations; and (b) it helps students better understand how organizations are shaped by the people that populate them.Note: Students who have received credit for this topic under a MSCA 652 number may not take this course for credit.|https://www.concordia.ca/academics/graduate/calendar/current/jmsb/management-msc.html

To accomplish this aim the seminar focuses on some basic sociological tools for conceptually investigating a variety of organizational topics. Students acquire an in-depth understanding of how organizations are made up of formal, relational and cultural structures both inside and outside the organizational boundary. Some topics and conceptual frameworks include power, conflict, organizational identity and image, organizational control, discourse and rhetoric, legitimacy, organizational impression management, emergence of new organizations, and organizational change.|https://www.concordia.ca/academics/graduate/calendar/current/jmsb/management-msc.html
646|MSCA|Seminar in Leadership| This course adopts the interactional framework of leadership, which considers that the leadership process is a function of three components: the leader, the followers, and the context. The course is structured to cover classic and emergent theories that address each of these components; though most theories focus on one of these three components, they also inform the other components in the model, either implicitly or explicitly. Implications for the practice of leadership are addressed through class discussions. An effort is made to ensure that students do not adopt a myopic view of leadership. Rather, different perspectives on the process of leadership are presented, that make radically different assumptions. Students are therefore required to identify these assumptions and develop well-articulated arguments that either support or refute these assumptions in order to develop a sophisticated view of leadership. Note: Students who have received credit for this topic under a MSCA 652 number may not take this course for credit.|https://www.concordia.ca/academics/graduate/calendar/current/jmsb/management-msc.html

648|MSCA|Seminar in International Management| This seminar is designed to introduce students to the key concepts and important areas of research related to globalization, multinational corporate strategies, and organizations and management systems in both developed and developing countries.

649|MSCA|Seminar in Comparative Corporate Governance| Corporate governance, defined broadly, is the study of power and influence over decision making within the corporation. Comparative corporate governance examines how institutions in different social and economic contexts influence this relationship and its consequences for the ownership, management, and strategic competitiveness of firms. In this seminar we address questions such as: How is corporate governance practised in different countries? Why are corporate governance practices similar or different across countries? Can we identify international best practices of corporate governance? To what extent are corporate governance best practices transferable across international contexts? How do different systems of corporate governance embody different economic, social, and political trade-offs among corporate stakeholders? We approach the questions from managerial, economic, legal, political, sociological and cultural perspectives. Using both conceptual and empirical studies, we also focus on a range of substantial issues, including corporate governance in family firms and in emerging market business groups.

There is a strong emphasis on critical reasoning, empirical scrutiny and theoretical development. Students develop competencies in all aspects of the entrepreneurship research process, culminating with their own independent contributions to the field through a novel research paper.
